# Hi there! 👋 I'm Nehuen Guevara

### Software Engineer | Backend & Distributed Systems
**Computer Science Analyst (FaMAF, UNC) | GPA: 9.0/10**

I focus on building robust software architectures, moving beyond traditional CRUD to solve critical infrastructure challenges: **Massive Concurrency, Latency, and Distributed Scalability**. My approach combines deep systems engineering ("under the hood" optimizations) with modern agile product development.
