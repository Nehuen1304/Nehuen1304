# Hi there! 👋 I'm Nehuen Guevara

### Software Engineer | Backend & Distributed Systems
**Computer Science Analyst (FaMAF, UNC) | GPA: 9.0/10**

I focus on building robust software architectures, moving beyond traditional CRUD to solve critical infrastructure challenges: **Massive Concurrency, Latency, and Distributed Scalability**. My approach combines deep systems engineering ("under the hood" optimizations) with modern agile product development.

## 🚀 Featured Engineering Projects

Here are the systems I have engineered to solve specific performance and scalability problems:

### 🎮 [Real-Time Multiplayer Platform](https://github.com/Nehuen1304/realtime-multiplayer-game-platform)
**Tech:** `FastAPI` `WebSockets` `React` `Docker`
* Full-stack game engine achieving **sub-100ms latency** for concurrent players.
* Implemented a hybrid SOA architecture using HTTP REST for transactions and WebSockets for real-time state streaming.

### ⚡ [High-Concurrency Flash Sale Engine](https://github.com/Nehuen1304/flash-sale-concurrency-engine)
**Tech:** `Python` `Redis` `Lua Scripts` `Docker`
* Inventory system designed to handle **1,000+ requests per second** during traffic spikes.
* Guaranteed transactional integrity and idempotency using atomic Lua scripting within Redis.

### 📊 [Distributed Big Data Processor](https://github.com/Nehuen1304/distributed-bigdata-processor-spark)
**Tech:** `Apache Spark` `Java` `Distributed Systems`
* Data pipeline optimizing network I/O and RDD partitioning for large-scale XML/JSON datasets.
* Implemented fault-tolerance mechanisms (checkpointing) based on distributed consensus principles.

### 🐧 [xv6 Kernel Scheduler (MLFQ)](https://github.com/Nehuen1304/xv6-kernel-scheduler-mlfq)
**Tech:** `C` `Operating Systems` `Kernel Hacking`
* Modified the xv6 OS kernel to implement a **Multi-Level Feedback Queue** scheduler.
* Reduced average process turnaround time by **35%** for CPU-bound workloads.
